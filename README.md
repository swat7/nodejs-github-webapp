# nodejs-github-webapp
A Nodejs application which shows information about a specified github repository

Github web api has been used to fetch user information and repository information. 
This app has been deployed to heroku.
Heroku link is: https://rocky-bastion-6419.herokuapp.com/

The code has been written in JQuery.

Input to the web app is a url to any public repository.
Output is Username, link to profile, and table containing information about the number of issues opened in the repository.

Things that can be done in future - 
The code can be written in some MVC patterned language such as AngularJS so that logic and view can be separated. It can be subdivided into multiple files instead of just one index.ejs file.
